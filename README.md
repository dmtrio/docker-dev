# Agent Dev Containers

Isolated, firewalled Docker environments where AI coding agents work with
full permissions — locally on your Mac (or any Docker host). One container
per project, declared by a manifest. The assembly is a config.

```
containers/<name>.yml  ──./up.sh <name>──►  dev-agent-<name>
        │                                      ├── agents: claude, codex, pi,
.dev-agent/secrets.env                         │   gemini, cursor-agent, aider
  (all secret values, gitignored;              ├── egress firewall (zone allowlist)
   move via DEV_AGENT_HOME)                     ├── /workspace (volume): main/ + worktrees/
                                               ├── /agent-rules (ro): global rules + skills
rules/  (bundled default;                       ├── /artifacts → Mac-visible outbox
  override via RULES_PATH)                      └── per-agent identity via shims
```

The repo is self-contained: a fresh clone runs with no external setup.
Runtime state (`secrets.env`, keys, artifacts) defaults to a gitignored
`./.dev-agent/`, and rules come from the bundled `rules/`. A gitignored
`./.env` overrides both — see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

## The two files you author

1. **`containers/<name>.yml`** — one manifest = one container: repo, memory,
   tools, capability grants, per-agent identities. Secret-free, committable.
   Copy `containers/TEMPLATE.yml` and edit.
2. **`secrets.env`** — every secret value, one file, mode 600, never mounted
   (default `./.dev-agent/secrets.env`, gitignored). Copy `secrets.env.example`
   and fill in what your manifests reference.

Everything else is derived: `./up.sh <name>` (idempotent) composes
credentials, applies the firewall, clones the repo, lays out worktrees, and
generates MCP configs. `./down.sh <name>` stops (code survives);
`--purge` forgets the container entirely (artifacts still survive).

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- `yq` (`brew install yq`)
- `python3` (any 3.9+, stdlib only — present via Xcode CLT on macOS; on a
  minimal Linux box, `apt install python3`). `up.sh` uses it for manifest
  validation and the wiring payload, preferring `/usr/bin/python3` over
  version-manager shims (`PYTHON3=/path` overrides).

That's it — the repo is self-contained. `up.sh` keeps its runtime state
(secrets, keys, artifacts) in a gitignored `./.dev-agent/` and uses the
bundled `rules/`. To point at your own locations instead, drop a gitignored
`./.env` at the repo root:

```bash
DEV_AGENT_HOME="$HOME/dev-agent"           # move the runtime home (secrets/keys/artifacts)
RULES_PATH="$HOME/git/agent-conf/rules"    # use your own rules repo instead of bundled rules/
CONTAINERS_PATH="$HOME/dev-agent/containers"  # read manifests from your own (private) dir
```

(When `DEV_AGENT_HOME` is set and `$DEV_AGENT_HOME/rules` exists, it's used as
the rules dir automatically — no need to set `RULES_PATH` too. The same applies
to manifests: if `$DEV_AGENT_HOME/containers` exists it's used automatically, so
you don't need to set `CONTAINERS_PATH` either.)

**Keep your manifests out of this repo.** Your real `containers/*.yml` carry
semi-private data (private repo URLs, LAN subnets, identity naming), so this
repo ships only `containers/TEMPLATE.yml`. Point manifests at a directory of
your own — e.g. `~/dev-agent/containers` (auto-detected) — and make *that* its
own private git repo. The tool stays public; your configs stay private and
versioned, with no second copy of the project to maintain.

## Quick start

```bash
cp containers/TEMPLATE.yml containers/my-app.yml
./up.sh my-app
```

`TEMPLATE.yml` runs unedited (blank repo → git-inits an empty workspace, no
identities → needs no secrets), so a copy is a working smoke test. Then edit it
— repo URL, memory, capabilities, identities — and rerun (idempotent). Add any
secrets it references to `secrets.env`:

```bash
mkdir -p .dev-agent && cp secrets.env.example .dev-agent/secrets.env   # up.sh also creates it empty
```

Then attach: VS Code / Cursor → **"Dev Containers: Attach to Running
Container"** → `dev-agent-my-app` (lands as `coder` in `/workspace` — open
`dev.code-workspace` for the multi-root worktree view). Terminal:
`docker exec -it -u coder dev-agent-my-app bash`. Run `claude` from
`/workspace/main`.

**First session per container** (persists across rebuilds in per-container
auth volumes): `claude` login; `codex` / `gemini` if used. Agents already
carry the GitHub machine-user token from `secrets.env`.

## Shell aliases (optional)

`up.sh` / `down.sh` / `service.sh` resolve their own location, so they run from
any directory. Drop these in `~/.bashrc` to invoke them from anywhere (each
lists its options when run with no argument):

```bash
export DA_REPO="$HOME/git/docker-dev"        # adjust to your clone
alias daup="$DA_REPO/up.sh"                   # daup <name>          (no arg → lists manifests)
alias dadown="$DA_REPO/down.sh"               # dadown <name> [--purge]
alias dasvc="$DA_REPO/service.sh"             # dasvc <name> [args]  (no arg → lists host services)
alias daegress="$DA_REPO/bin/allow-egress.sh" # daegress <container> <domain>…
alias cdda="cd \$DA_REPO"
```

Tab-completion for container names (`daup`/`dadown`) and host services (`dasvc`):

```bash
_da_ctr_dir() {   # mirrors common.sh's CONTAINERS_PATH resolution
  if   [ -n "$CONTAINERS_PATH" ];                                  then echo "$CONTAINERS_PATH"
  elif [ -d "${DEV_AGENT_HOME:-$DA_REPO/.dev-agent}/containers" ]; then echo "${DEV_AGENT_HOME:-$DA_REPO/.dev-agent}/containers"
  else echo "$DA_REPO/containers"; fi
}
_da_names() {
  local d f names=""; d="$(_da_ctr_dir)"
  for f in "$d"/*.yml; do f=${f##*/}; [ "$f" = TEMPLATE.yml ] && continue; names="$names ${f%.yml}"; done
  COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "$names" -- "${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"))
}
complete -F _da_names daup dadown
_da_services() {
  local p names=""
  for p in "$DA_REPO"/plugins/*/run.sh; do [ -e "$p" ] && names="$names $(basename "$(dirname "$p")")"; done
  COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "$names" -- "${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"))
}
complete -F _da_services dasvc
```

macOS defaults to zsh. The aliases work in `~/.zshrc` unchanged. For completion,
use the native zsh version below — `(N)` makes the globs no-match-safe. Needs
`compinit` to have run (frameworks like oh-my-zsh already do it):

```zsh
_da_names_zsh() {   # container short-names; mirrors common.sh's CONTAINERS_PATH resolution
  local dir
  if   [ -n "$CONTAINERS_PATH" ]; then dir="$CONTAINERS_PATH"
  elif [ -d "${DEV_AGENT_HOME:-$DA_REPO/.dev-agent}/containers" ]; then dir="${DEV_AGENT_HOME:-$DA_REPO/.dev-agent}/containers"
  else dir="$DA_REPO/containers"; fi
  local -a names=(${dir}/*.yml(N:t:r)); names=(${names:#TEMPLATE})
  compadd -a names
}
compdef _da_names_zsh daup dadown

_da_services_zsh() {   # plugins that ship a run.sh (:h dir, :t tail = plugin name)
  local -a names=(${DA_REPO}/plugins/*/run.sh(N:h:t))
  compadd -a names
}
compdef _da_services_zsh dasvc
```

## Firewall egress (`capabilities:`)

| Manifest key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `egress: [...]` | extra allowed zones (a zone covers its subdomains) |
| `egress_cidrs: [...]` | IP-range escape hatch (LAN subnets) |

A container without a grant cannot reach the zone — enforced by the
in-container firewall (dnsmasq resolver-driven ipset; rotating CDN DNS can't
outrun it).

> The old `gateway`/`proxyman`/`browser` capability flags are **plugins** now
> (see below). `capabilities: {gateway: true}` still works for one release but
> prints a deprecation warning — prefer `plugins: [gateway]`.

## Plugins (every MCP server is a file)

A **plugin** is a directory — `plugins/<name>/` — describing an MCP server (or
just a secret) a container can get. A manifest opts in by name; unlisted plugins
stay dormant in the shared image:

```yaml
plugins: [serena, gateway, obsidian-annotated]
```

Two shapes, decided by the entry (no `type:` field):

- **Local** — a stdio server baked into the image (`command:` + `install:`),
  wired into every installed agent.
- **Remote** — an HTTP server (`url:`), on the Mac host (`host_port:`, started
  with `./service.sh <name>`) or a real internet host.

A plugin may also be **env-only** — a `secrets:` slot with no server. Slots are
`env`-scoped (one value shared by all agents) or `agent`-scoped (per-agent,
bound under the manifest's `agent_secrets:`). `up.sh` derives the wiring and
folds each plugin's `egress`/`host_port` into the firewall; de-listing one
removes its wiring on the next up.

**→ [`plugins/README.md`](plugins/README.md)** — the schema, how wiring works,
and how to add a plugin. Each **`plugins/<name>/README.md`** documents that
plugin.

## Secrets model

Secret **values** live in one file — `secrets.env` (mode 600, gitignored, never
mounted). Manifests and the Python modules handle only secret **names**; values
are resolved host-side at `up` time. Plugins declare **secret slots**, each
scoped:

- **env-scoped** — one value shared by every agent (service tokens). Bound with
  `common_secrets:`; a slot defaults to a same-named `secrets.env` var.
- **agent-scoped** — each agent gets its own value (e.g. a per-agent Obsidian
  key). Bound with `agent_secrets:`, one record per (agent, slot, source var);
  a dangling source hard-fails at `up`.

**Per-agent shims deliver them.** Each agent CLI is fronted by a shim that, at
process start, loads only that agent's `~/.agent-keys/<agent>.env` — the
env-scoped secrets plus that agent's own agent-scoped keys — and overrides
inherited env before exec'ing the real binary. Two consequences:

- `cat <agent>.env` is the full audit of exactly what that agent sees.
- Delegation is safe: when claude spawns `cursor-agent -p`, the child's shim
  loads *its* identity — the invoker's credentials never leak.

GitHub rides the same path: agents act as the machine user (`GH_TOKEN`); your
personal login never enters a container unless you `gh auth login` there, and
agent PRs/comments show as the bot (you review and merge as you).

## Rules & skills (shared knowledge, never shared identity)

The rules dir mounts read-only at `/agent-rules` in every container:
`AGENTS.md` fans out as every agent's global rules file, `skills/` as
Claude's skills. By default this is the repo's bundled `rules/`; set
`RULES_PATH` (in `./.env`) to your own rules repo — e.g. `~/git/agent-conf/rules`
— to override. Rule layers: global → `/workspace/rules.local.md`
(container-local, uncommitted) → the project repo's own CLAUDE.md.
Agents propose rule changes via PR; for an external rules repo, `up.sh`
`git pull`s it each run so merged changes land in every container.

## Persistence map

| State | Lives in | Survives recreate | Survives `--purge` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Code | workspace volume (+ git) | ✓ | ✗ (git: forever) |
| Agent logins, MCP approvals | per-container auth volumes | ✓ | ✗ |
| Identity keys | `secrets.env` (composed at up) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Rules & skills | bundled `rules/` (or your `RULES_PATH` repo) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Non-code outputs | `$DEV_AGENT_HOME/artifacts/<name>/` (`/artifacts`) | ✓ | ✓ |

## Repo map

- `up.sh` / `down.sh` / `service.sh` — the commands you run from the repo root:
  `up.sh` / `down.sh` are container lifecycle from manifests; `service.sh <name>`
  starts a plugin's Mac-side host service (see `plugins/`)
- `containers/` — manifests (`TEMPLATE.yml` to copy; your own are gitignored)
- `plugins/` — drop-in MCP tools, one directory each (`<name>/plugin.yml` +
  optional host-only `<name>/run.sh`, started via `./service.sh <name>`). See
  [`plugins/README.md`](plugins/README.md) for the schema and how to add one
- `rules/` — bundled default agent rules & skills (override via `RULES_PATH`)
- `bin/` — host commands you run occasionally (`up.sh` / `down.sh` / `service.sh`
  are the daily ones and stay at the root):
  - `allow-egress.sh` — add egress domains to a running container (no restart)
  - `update-agent-keys.sh` — temporary per-agent key override; durable changes
    go in secrets.env
- `src/` — internal source, never run directly:
  - `common.sh` — shared path resolution (sourced by the scripts)
  - `manifest.py` — host-side manifest validation; `wire_plugins.py` — the
    agent-config writer `up.sh` execs after boot; `keyfiles.sh` — host-side
    key-file composition `up.sh` sources
  - `entrypoint.sh`, `init-firewall.sh`, `tmux*`, `mosh-server-wrapper.sh` —
    baked into the image
- `compose/` — `docker-compose.local.yml` (base) plus the `ssh.yml` / `mosh.yml`
  overlays `up.sh` applies for a manifest's `ssh:` / `remote.mosh` settings
- `docs/` — `script.md` (every script, grouped by lifecycle), `TIPS.md`,
  `workspace.CLAUDE.md` (copied into each container as `/workspace/CLAUDE.md`)
- `tests/` — host-runnable checks. `plugins.test.sh` is the entry point (yq +
  jq + python3); it runs the Python unit tests (`test_manifest.py` /
  `test_wire_plugins.py` — manifest validation + wiring logic) and the
  host-side bash unit tests (`bash.test.sh` — `keyfiles.sh`, `common.sh`,
  `allow-egress.sh`, `update-agent-keys.sh`, `service.sh`, the
  `plugins/*/run.sh` token generation)
- `Dockerfile` — the shared image and its contracts
- `secrets.env.example` — template for your `secrets.env`
- `.env` (gitignored) — optional `DEV_AGENT_HOME` / `RULES_PATH` /
  `DEV_AGENT_SUBNET` overrides

## Remote hosts (Linux server or VPS)

Same system, same files, one addition. On any Linux box with Docker:

1. Install `yq` (static binary) and `python3`, and clone this repo. The bundled `rules/`
   and gitignored `./.dev-agent/` work as-is; set `DEV_AGENT_HOME` /
   `RULES_PATH` in `./.env` only if you want them elsewhere.
2. Put your secrets in `secrets.env` (default `./.dev-agent/secrets.env`,
   600) — including `SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEY` (your public key).
3. Add an `ssh:` section to the container's manifest:

   ```yaml
   ssh:
     port: 2222        # published on the host
     bind: 127.0.0.1   # keep loopback; reach it through your tunnel
   ```

4. `./up.sh <name>` — identical to the Mac. Connect with VS Code
   **Remote-SSH** to the host/port; everything else (firewall, secrets,
   rules, artifacts) behaves exactly the same.

Never expose sshd publicly: keep the bind on loopback (or a tunnel
interface) and front it with your WireGuard/VPN tunnel. The remote MCP
plugins (`gateway`/`proxyman`/`browser`) are Mac-desktop services — on
headless hosts leave them out of `plugins:` or run the host service on that
host.

## Remote agent access (phone / second device)

The `remote:` manifest block (requires `ssh:`) turns an SSH-reachable
container into something you can drive from a phone — start a task, walk
away, get pinged when the agent needs you, answer from anywhere. Works for
every agent in the image; nothing is vendor-hosted or public-facing.

```yaml
ssh:     { port: 2222, bind: 127.0.0.1 }
remote:  { tmux: true, mosh: true, notify: ntfy }
```

- **tmux** — interactive SSH/mosh logins land attached to one durable
  session (`agent`). Phone and laptop share the same view; agents survive
  disconnects. `docker exec` and editor terminals are exempt.
- **mosh** — a per-manifest UDP range (`remote.mosh_ports`, default
  60000:60010; disjoint per container, like `ssh.port`), published next to
  sshd with the same bind rules and pinned server-side. Survives phone
  sleep and WiFi↔cellular switches; use a mosh-capable client (e.g. Moshi
  or Blink on iOS).
- **notify: ntfy** — an agent-blind monitor pushes to your ntfy topic when
  the session goes idle at a prompt and nobody is attached. Set `NTFY_URL`
  (+ optional `NTFY_TOPIC`) in `secrets.env`; the host is auto-allowlisted.

**Reach.** All containers sit on one shared bridge (`dev-agent-net`,
`172.30.0.0/24` by default, `DEV_AGENT_SUBNET` in `./.env` to override;
created automatically by `up.sh`). Point your WireGuard/VPN layer at that
CIDR once and every container is reachable at its bridge IP from any
enrolled device — `up.sh` prints the IP in its summary. sshd and the mosh
range stay loopback/tunnel-only; nothing listens publicly.
