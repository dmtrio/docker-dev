#!/bin/bash
# service.sh <name> [args...] — start a plugin's host-side service on this Mac.
#
# Some plugins are backed by a service that runs on the HOST, not in a
# container: the gateway (Playwright MCP), proxyman (traffic capture bridge),
# and browser (a watchable desktop browser). Each ships a run.sh in its plugin
# directory; this dispatcher starts it so you never need the path:
#
#   ./service.sh gateway          # execs plugins/gateway/run.sh
#   ./service.sh browser chrome   # extra args are forwarded to run.sh
#   ./service.sh                  # lists plugins that ship a host service
#
# Run each in its own tmux window (or wrap in a launchd plist for boot
# persistence) and leave it running; containers reach it via the port its
# plugin.yml declares.
#
# This is DELIBERATELY separate from ./up.sh: up.sh recreates a container
# (docker compose up --build), which would kill a running agent — starting a
# host service must never carry that risk, nor sit one typo away from it.
# service.sh never touches docker.
#
# service.sh is the one place that knows the dev-agent home: it sources
# src/common.sh (once, at the repo root — no ../ path arithmetic) to resolve
# BASE_PATH and hands it to the launcher in the environment, so each run.sh
# needs zero path knowledge of its own. common.sh is sourced LATE (just before
# exec), so the usage/list/error paths above it never depend on ./.env —
# mirroring bin/allow-egress.sh.
