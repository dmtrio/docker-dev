"""Container freshness readout — format the one-line landing readout.

`up.sh` writes two host-truth timestamps into /etc/environment after boot:

  DEV_AGENT_UP_AT       ISO8601 UTC of the last `./up.sh` (governs the freshness
                        of external rules — pulled each `up` — and MCP wiring).
  DEV_AGENT_IMAGE_BUILT the image's real `.Created` (governs the baked half:
                        bundled rules, plugin AGENTS.md fragments, install:
                        blocks). `up.sh` uses `--build`, which is cache-gated,
                        so a full cache hit leaves this old — exactly the honest
                        signal for how stale the image is.

Two stamps because layer caching makes them diverge: you can `up` daily for two
weeks while the image build stays two weeks old, so a single "created on" would
mislead about whichever half it is not measuring.

`freshness-landing.bashrc` invokes this from interactive shells. It prints ONE
dim line — or nothing, when no stamp is present (a readout, never an alarm):

  container: up'd 2026-07-21 (1d ago) · image built 2026-07-08 (14d ago)

No network, no side effects; the relative age uses the container's own clock.
