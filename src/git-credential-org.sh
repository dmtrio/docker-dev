# git-credential-org — route github.com credentials by repo owner.
#
# git invokes a credential helper as `<helper> get` with the request (protocol,
# host, and — because we set credential.useHttpPath=true — path) on stdin. The
# first path segment is the forge owner. We return GH_TOKEN_<owner> if that var
# is set (per-org identity), else the default GH_TOKEN (container identity),
# else defer to `gh auth git-credential` for the human's interactive login. So
# one credential lane serves agents (token by owner) AND humans (gh fallback).
#
# The <owner> → GH_TOKEN_<owner> sanitization MUST match
# manifest.py:_canonical_token_var byte-for-byte: lowercase the owner (github
# owners are case-insensitive; the owner here comes from the clone URL, whose
# case we don't control), then GH_TOKEN_ + every non-alphanumeric byte replaced
# by '_'. A mismatch silently mis-routes to the default token — the exact bug
# this feature exists to prevent.
#
# Forge is github-only for now (entrypoint installs this helper only for
# https://github.com). gitea is a follow-up.
