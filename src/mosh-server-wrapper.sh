# mosh-server wrapper — installed as /usr/local/bin/mosh-server, which
# precedes /usr/bin on PATH, so the `mosh-server new ...` command that the
# mosh client launches over SSH resolves here. Pins the server to the UDP
# range the firewall accepts and the compose overlay publishes; a client
# cannot land on an unreachable port.
#
# The pin must be spliced BEFORE the first `--`: with `mosh host -- cmd`
# the client sends `mosh-server new [opts] -- cmd`, and getopt stops at
# `--`, so an appended -p would become argv of the remote command and the
# pin silently dropped. Placed there it also wins over any client-sent -p
# (mosh-server takes the last occurrence). Non-`new` invocations use the
# legacy positional syntax, which takes no options — pass through untouched.
