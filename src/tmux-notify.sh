# tmux-notify.sh — agent-blind idle notifier (RFC 04 Phase B).
# Fired by tmux's alert-silence hook (armed in tmux.conf only when NTFY_URL
# is present): the pane produced no output for the monitor-silence window,
# which for an agent means "waiting at a prompt" or "finished". Deliberately
# knows nothing about WHICH agent runs in the pane — works for all of them.
#
# Suppression: if any client is attached you are already looking at the
# session — pushing would self-notify on every pause. Only push when nobody
# is watching.
#
# $1: the window that went silent (tmux.conf passes #{hook_window}) — the
# alert-silence hook is server-global, so without it we'd capture whatever
# session 'agent' happens to front, not the pane that idled. Falls back to
# the landing session's name for manual/legacy invocations.
