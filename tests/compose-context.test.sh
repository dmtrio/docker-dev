# tests/compose-context.test.sh — guards the compose build context against the
# root-reorg regression: the compose files live in compose/, so compose derives
# the project directory from the first -f file unless up.sh pins it. When that
# pin is missing, `context: .` resolves to compose/ and the build dies with
# "failed to read dockerfile: open Dockerfile: no such file or directory".
# Static checks only — no docker needed.

# SC2015 (`A && pass || fail` is not if-else): intentional — pass() is a bare
# echo and cannot fail, so the || arm only runs when the check fails.
# shellcheck disable=SC2015
