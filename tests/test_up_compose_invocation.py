"""Guards the `docker compose up` invocation in up.sh.

The invocation is a chain of env-var prefixes joined by trailing backslashes,
ending in the `docker compose` call. That shape has a silent failure mode:
a backslash-newline splices the following line in, so a comment or blank line
inserted mid-chain turns every prefix above it into a commented-out no-op and
compose runs with all of those variables unset. `bash -n` still passes, and so
does any grep that only looks for the flag — the damage is only visible at
runtime as `invalid spec: :/artifacts: empty section between colons`.

These tests splice the continuations into logical lines and assert the env
prefixes and the compose call really are one command.
